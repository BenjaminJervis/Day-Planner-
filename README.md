# Module-7- Calender Day Planner 
 
# Project Title
Day Planner Calender 

# Description
In this challenge, I was required to use the concepts I have learned during the bootcamp so far on Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jquery and moment.js to complete the required task as per the readme file. 

We were required to create a simple calender application. This a simple app which allows the user to save events for each hour of their working day. The calender runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. In addition the app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) along the left hand side of each input row. Depending on the time of day, the schedule input feilds update their color indicating to the user wether items are in the past, present or future.

# Getting Started
To help get started we were provided with a some intial HTML code to create the time blocks, basic HTML for the layout and CSS code. 
Firstly I created a new GitHub repo called `Day Planner`. Then, cloned it to my computer. I then copied the starter files to my local git repository and added HTML to create the time blocks.

# Technologies used 
I used the following technologies to create my day calender so that the user can plan their working day. These were: 
jQuery - I used this for event listeners of parent and children elements as well as to store and recall those varible in local storage.
momentjs - I used moment to pull the current date and local time so that it could be displayed at the top of the page.
javascript - JS was used to dynamically change html and store user-input.
Bootstrap - Used to pull existing html and CSS for creating responsive structre and styling for the site.
HTML - HTML was used to create elements on the DOM
CSS - Styles html elements on page
Git - Version control system to track changes to source code
GitHub - Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages
